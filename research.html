              <p>
                The performance ceiling of AI models highly depends on the quality and diversity of training data. We focus on three core challenges in the data supply chain:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Pre-training Data Preparation: Building large-scale multilingual, multi-domain corpora from various sources such as the internet, PDF literature, and e-book libraries, implementing data "refinement" through deduplication, denoising, and toxicity filtering processes to support training requirements for InternLM series and various text and multimodal large models.</li>
                <li>Multilingual and Low-resource Data Enhancement: Focusing on countries along the Belt and Road Initiative and resource-scarce languages (such as Hungarian, Czech, etc.), building large-scale multilingual, multimodal data corpora (the open-sourced InternLM-Wanjuan corpus), promoting the development of small language large models and various potential applications.</li>
                <li>Scientific Intelligence Data Exploration: For high-value AI4Science scenarios, conducting collection, screening, synthesis, and other work on high-quality, high-density scientific intelligence data, and developing important AI4Science research such as scientific intelligence foundation models based on scientific data.</li>
